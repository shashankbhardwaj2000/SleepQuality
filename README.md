Sleep Quality Predictor

This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts sleep quality based on various sleep-related factors. The model is trained on a dataset that includes information such as steps taken, alarm usage, time spent in bed, time asleep, time before sleep, and snoring incidents. The model uses a Random Forest algorithm to make predictions.

The main components of this repository are:
- `main.py`: This is the main script that allows users to input their sleep-related information and get a prediction of their sleep quality. Users can also provide feedback on the accuracy of the prediction to update and improve the model.
- `sleepdata.csv`: This file contains the dataset used to train the model. It includes historical sleep-related data and corresponding sleep quality ratings.
- `best_model.pkl`: This is the serialized version of the trained Random Forest model, saved using the Joblib library.

To use the Sleep Quality Predictor, simply run the `main.py` script and follow the instructions. The script will prompt you to enter your sleep-related information, and it will provide a prediction of your sleep quality. You can also provide feedback on the accuracy of the prediction, which will help improve the model over time.

Feel free to explore the code, dataset, and model in this repository. You can also contribute to the project by suggesting improvements, adding new features, or enhancing the model's accuracy. Contributions are welcome through pull requests.

Happy predicting and sleep well!
